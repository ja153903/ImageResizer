# Resize Images

This project was built for NYU CS-GY 9163 - Application Security Lab 1a

Written in Kotlin

For now, we have a command line application which asks the user to enter
an absolute path to an image.

Sample Output:
```$xslt
Enter absolute path for image:
/Users/jaime/Downloads/560044.jpg

Enter new width and height:
100

File already exists. So we will overwrite it
```

The output path will be a modification of the input path:

```$xslt
Original Path: /Users/jaime/Downloads/560044.jpg

Output Path: /Users/jaime/Downloads/560044_result.jpg
```
